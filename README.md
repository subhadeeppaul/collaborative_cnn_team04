# Collaborative CNN Project - Cats vs Dogs

This repository is for our deep learning assignment.

- Task: Image classification (cats vs dogs)
- User 1: <Subhadeep Paul> - using the TongPython cats vs dogs dataset
- User 2: <Prajjval Govil>> - using another cats vs dogs dataset

We will each train a CNN model on our own dataset and test how well the models work on each other’s data.
